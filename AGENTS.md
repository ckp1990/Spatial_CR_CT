# Spatial Capture-Recapture Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains R scripts for applying Spatial Capture-Recapture (SCR) models to estimate closed animal populations. The primary analysis involves processing capture history data, running MCMC simulations, and generating density estimates.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: R
- **Key Libraries**: `coda`, `mcmcse`, `dplyr`, `PerformanceAnalytics`, `correlation`

## Key Files
- `Analysis_code_gender_sps.R`: Main script for gender-specific spatial analysis, including data loading, MCMC diagnostics (Gelman-Rubin), and density estimation.
- `SCRi.fn.par1.R`: Helper functions for the SCR model parameters.

## Integration Notes
This file is intended to provide context for AI agents (like Google Jules) to better understand the repository structure and purpose.
